CardTag is a way to run Gorilla Tag on a Google Cardboard. Here is how.

1.  Every time a Gorilla Tag Steam VR (PC-VR) update comes out, our app will detect that.
    
2.  When an update is released, your Windows device will be asked to update it on Steam.
    
3.  Your Android/iOS will stream the content over to your Google Cardboard with "splitting" the game in half and making it look like a Google Cardboard app.

4.  Your Android/iOS will receive the "message" from your Windows device and install it

5.  Enjoy CardTag!
