AVPTag is a way to run Gorilla Tag on a Google Cardboard. Here is how.

1.  Every time a Gorilla Tag Steam VR (PC-VR) update comes out, our app will detect that.
    
2.  When an update is released, your Windows device will be asked to update it on Steam.
    
3.  Your Android will stream the content over to your Google Cardboard with "splitting" the game in half and making it look like a Google Cardboard app.

4.  Your Android will receive the "message" from your Windows device and install it

5.  Enjoy CardTag!
